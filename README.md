If you want to use try this out yourself, you first need to set up a project on Aamu.app which will host your data. 

See the demo site here: **[DEMO](https://gatsby-aamu-portfolio.netlify.com/)**

### Create an Aamu.app account

To use this website, you need an [Aamu.app](https://aamu.app/) account. Create one/log into your account and then create a database from the template **gatsby-aamu-portfolio**:

After that, you need an **API key**. Go to database settings for your newly created database and create an API key. Copy-paste that to somewhere safe.
